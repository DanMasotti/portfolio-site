          Leaving undergrad with an applied math background, I chose the
          Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning pathway as a CS masters
          student. However, I fell in love with visual computing along the way.
          Although I was a hobbyist 3D modeller/animator before graduate school,
          I learned that computer graphics, inverse rendering, and building
          tools/synthetic data for computer vision tasks using tools from
          numerical linear algebra was something I really enjoyed and am good
          at.

          At Brown's Interative 3D Vision and Learning Lab, I engineered a novel
          environment simulator for mixed reality datasets (real and virtual
          objects). This context-aware mixed reality approach to data generation
          has the advantage of known labels for virtual objects from Shapenet,
          for example, while also grounding our algorithms in real world scenes.{" "}

        As an undergraduate at Brown, I was a member of the Brown Music Co-op as
        well as head designer for Brown Data Science Club. I was also an Applied
        Math Peer Advisor and regularly met with mentees to discuss course plans
        and our department. During Junior Spring, I was selected by the Directed
        Reading Program to research large-scale computational linear algebra.
        Specifically, I worked with a graduate student on large, sparse systems
        of linear equations, for which modern iterative linear solvers such as
        Conjugate Gradient and the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES) methods
        combined with computational techniques such as preconditioning offer
        substantial performance boost.
